# 1TOOL1 - Chatting using PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).

---

## What is this?

A secure and user-friendly messaging platform designed to promote privacy through PGP encryption. With 1tool1, users can  generate a unique ID and a pair of PGP keys (public and private) to communicate securely with others. The goal of this project is to make PGP encryption accessible and easy to use, escpecially for beginners.

The name 1tool1 is a wordplay that reflects its purpose: "1 tool" for secure communication and enabling "1 to 1" private conversations.
